The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error where the specificity of selectors can lead to unexpected results:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this case, `div p` is more specific than `p`, so the first rule will override the second, resulting in the paragraph text always being blue. This can be unexpected if the developer intended the second rule to apply to paragraphs not within a div.
