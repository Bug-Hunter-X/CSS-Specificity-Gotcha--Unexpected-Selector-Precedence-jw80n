To solve this, you can adjust the order or specificity of the selectors. Here are two solutions:

**Solution 1: Increase Specificity of the Less Specific Rule**

This method is preferred when the intent is to style the paragraph only if there is not a `div p` selector:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p.paragraph {
  color: red; /* Only applied to paragraphs with the class 'paragraph' */
}
```

**Solution 2: Use !important (Less Recommended)**

Using `!important` can override other stylesheets and should only be used as a last resort:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red !important; /* Forces the red color */
}
```

The best solution will depend on the overall CSS structure and the desired outcome.
